To Design and Develop an AI-Driven Decentralized Financial Risk Engine with Immersive Visualization.
The growth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has unlocked access to financial services beyond borders. However, users especially institutional investors and high-risk retail traders-face challenges in risk visibility, credit exposure, and smart contract security.
Our challenge is to build a next-gen Al-powered Risk Advisory Platform that allows users to:
Core Features:
1. Real-Time Risk Assessment for DeFi Portfolios
Pull data from blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) using APIs (Moralis, Alchemy, or Chainlink).
Use AI/ML to analyze wallet risk exposure, token volatility, and smart contract vulnerabilities.
Provide predictive risk scoring (VAR, Sharpe Ratio) using market history and news sentiment.

2. Web3 + Open Banking Integration
Enable linking of both traditional bank accounts (using Open Banking APIs like Fynapse, Yodlee, or Salt Edge) and DeFi wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect).
Create a hybrid risk profile for users spanning fiat and crypto assets.

3. Interactive XR Dashboard (AR/VR/XR)
Visualize user portfolios and risk zones using immersive dashboards.
Example: Use Unity or Three.js for 3D portfolio heatmaps or XR-based smart contract flow visualization.

4.Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for Privacy-Preserving Credit Scoring
Use ZK-SNARKs to share proof of credibility without exposing sensitive financial data.

5.Build a voice-activated Al financial assistant for immersive experiences.

6.Integrate generative AI (like GPT) to simulate "what-if" scenarios for market crashes.

7.Implement compliance rules using smart contracts (MiCA / FATF guidelines).

8.Tokenize digital identity or credit scores as NFTs for cross-platform lending.
